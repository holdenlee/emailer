Dear %s,

Thanks for participating in Artichoke Heart-to-Hearts! You have indicated that you are not available the coming week, so I have not matched you up with anyone. If this is not true, let me know; otherwise, no action is necessary.

I will be sending out matches every Sunday. If anything changes in your availability from what you wrote on the form, let me know by Saturday night.

Best,
Holden

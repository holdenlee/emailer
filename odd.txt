Dear %s,

Welcome to week %d of Artichoke Heart-to-Hearts! Due to an odd number of participating artichokes, we don't have a match for you this week. Hang tight and we'll find a match for you next time!

I will be sending out matches every Sunday. If you can't participate next week, let me know by Saturday night. Also let me know any feedback and suggestions you have.

Best,
Holden
